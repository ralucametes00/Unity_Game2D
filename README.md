Hi
I uploaded here the game I created using the "Complete C # Unity Game Developer 2D" course by GameDev.tv Team.
It is not in the final version because I encountered difficulties in making it. Since I added an enemy, the player has not jumped.

If you have any idea how I can fix the problem, I would be grateful!
